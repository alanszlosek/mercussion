Do I need such a deeply nested data structure? I guess it makes printing barlines in lilypond easier, but it doesn't help anything else. Might be able to do away with separate array of measures ... move beat arrays up a level.

music = [
	{timesignature: '3/4'},
	[
		{surface: r},
		{surface: r},
		{rest: True}
	],
	{timesignature: '4/4'}
]
