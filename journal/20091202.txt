MIDI output formulas

MICROSECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60000000
BPM = MICROSECONDS_PER_MINUTE / MPQN
MPQN = MICROSECONDS_PER_MINUTE / BPM

128 velocity is max volume

BPM = 120

Tempo = how many microseconds does a quarter note last = 60000000 / BPM
Division = click per quarter note 

I'm reading this MIDI website and I don't get it. I just need to start writing code so I can learn by doing.

Think I'm going to have to adjust the way I store durations in my data structure to simplify calculations. Most of our calculations will be applied to the number of ticks per beat ...

Simple dynamic changes are working, but not dynamic ranges (crescendos/de..). At least I no longer have to wait for lilypond to fix its MIDI output.

I'm not doing straight MIDI, I'm using midicomp, to convert an intermediate text format. Eventually I imagine I'll cut out the middle man.

I'll need this later, for lilypond
notes = len(beat)
tuple = False
if notes == 6 or notes == 5:
	duration = 16
	tuple = True
elif notes == 3:
	duration = 8
	tuple = True
else:
	duration = 4 * notes
