MIDI output formulas

MICROSECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60000000
BPM = MICROSECONDS_PER_MINUTE / MPQN
MPQN = MICROSECONDS_PER_MINUTE / BPM

128 velocity is max volume

BPM = 120


Tempo = how many microseconds does a quarter note last = 60000000 / BPM
Division = click per quarter note 


I'm reading this MIDI website and I don't get it. I just need to start writing code so I can try things.

Think I'm going to have to adjust the way I store durations in my data structure to simplify calculations. Most of our calculations will be applied to the number of ticks per beat ...


I'll need this later, for lilypond
notes = len(beat)
tuple = False
if notes == 6 or notes == 5:
	duration = 16
	tuple = True
elif notes == 3:
	duration = 8
	tuple = True
else:
	duration = 4 * notes
