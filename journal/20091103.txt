snare: F,hh,hh -h-hxh hhrhrhH.h. x

WHAT IF we could use r/l for the snare notes? and within a beat, emits sticking when notes stray from alternating pattern? 

- but how do shots?
        x - right shot
        z - left shot?
- what about buzzes, that would make sense as z?
	- a buzz is NOT a different surface, it's a stroke style?
	- tilde before note

For snare it can be super terse, but it's impossible for other drums ... so much more to capture

F,rr,ll -r-lxl rlrrl.r. z

- buzz ~
- rim x(tenor,snare: before note) OR r(snare)
- shot x y (right shot, left shot)
- backstick b c (right backstick, left backstick)
- head abcdefh
- accented UPPERCASE
- diddle -
- four =
- flam , (on snare, next note isn't a grace)
- right or left r l (snare, hands are the notes?)

I'm a programmer, working on a language of sorts for representing marching percussion music on the computer. I tend to like tools where I can enter data via keyboard instead of using mouse clicks.
