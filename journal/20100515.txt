Time to get cymbal notation down, at least something that will work with Virtual Drumline, since I now have that piece of software.

With cymbals there are a couple of new concepts to worry about. Choking is the main one. Crashes get choked. Slides get choked. And so on.

I suppose I don't need a universal choke surface, so I'll just use ! before the surface to indicate a choke. If 'b' is a slide, then !b would be the choke to complete the slide-choke action.
