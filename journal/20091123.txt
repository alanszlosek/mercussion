As we know, I want the notation to be as terse as possible, while still making sense. Today I realized a better way to specify sticking. But first, a recap of where I am today.

For snare, in the simplest case, the surface and the sticking can be specified by the same letter. r and l would represent hitting the snare head with the right and left hand. But this breaks down when you want to signify a left-hand rim shot or rim click.

snare: F,rr,ll -r-lxl rlrrl.r. z

The x is a right-hand shot. y would be a left-hand rim shot.

For tenors, this doesn't work because one also has to specify which drum, head/rim/shot, which hand and whether there's an accent. Lots of information. The accent can be taken care of with an uppercase drum specifier. a would be non-accented hit on the first drum, A would be an accented hit. Sometimes there's lots of sticking to specify, like a paradiddle on drum 2, specified with the following:

{rlrr}b

But this introduces two more characters, and can be confusing when there's lots of drum switching AND abnormal sticking. So I need something better.

How about this?

Specify the surface and accents for a given beat first, then specify the sticking.

aaaa:rlrr

That would be a paradiddle on the first tenor drum. The same would work for snare.

-h-hXh rrr.:rrr
