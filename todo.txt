- make sure: [abc][abc]r (triplet) works with lilypond output

- ability to insert a beat of rests before tapoff when compiling for midi output ... some players mess up when the notes start so soon
	- if i do my own midi output, this might be quite easy to do

- flags for which instruments to output (instead of all by default)
	- like this: --instrument snare,tenor

- interbeat tuplets
	- arg.
	- what if we simply set a flag when we hit '[': startsTuplet
	- we'd have to go back one note to decorate a note with endsTuplet when we hit ']'

- sub-beat tuplets
	- 16 16 (16 16 16)

- when compiling for midi output
	- add tap-off measure
	- expand tremolos

- crescendos and decrescendos
        - starting and stopping points attached to notes
	- don't need a dynamic to start a descrescendo/crescendo, but when in progress, a dynamic specifier STOPS it
	- but what if a cresc stops and a decre begins on the same note?

- plan cymbal notation

- shots on tenors

- ability to specify the number of basses for unison expansion

- ability to specify the measure to use for the tapoff (what if we don't want it to be snare?)

- annotate measures with timeSignature if one wasn't parsed
	- use beats in measure over 4 as default

- no more passing filenames ... read input as if from keyboard and print output
	- so on unix or windows one should use input/output redirection

- simultaneous notes become condensed in the surface string, rather than an array of other notes
	- because there's no need to allow simultaneous notes to have different dynamic settings (not possible on sheet music)

- if i'm going to output my own midi
	MICROSECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60000000
	BPM = MICROSECONDS_PER_MINUTE / MPQN
	MPQN = MICROSECONDS_PER_MINUTE / BPM

	128 velocity is max volume

- midi output
	- calculate and hardcode volume levels in score for dynamic ranges

Done:

- explicit \break every 4 measures
- proper clef on percussion staves
- so i think dividing the beat into notes and then sticking is a good idea, but what you only want to specify sticking for 2 out of 6 notes in the sticking: the last two notes? period spacers? 
- convert unisons to simultaneous notes

Bah

- flag for whether to expand tremolos, etc
	- needed for lilypond's midi output

Questions:

- deduce whether a note should be dotted automatically as a compiler optimization?

- how should i handle flams on tenors? new character?
	- do i condense the two notes following a comma into 1 note, with a flam flag, and a grace surface specifier?
