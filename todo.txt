- flag for whether to expand tremolos, etc
- sub-beat tuplets
- annotate measures with timeSignature if one wasn't parsed
	- use beats in measure over 4 as default
- when compiling for midi output
	- add tap-off measure
	- expand tremolos

- crescendos and decrescendos
        - starting and stopping points attached to notes
	- don't need a dynamic to start a descrescendo/crescendo, but when in progress, a dynamic specifier STOPS it
	- but what if a cresc stops and a decre begins on the same note?

- parse unisons into simultaneous notes?
        - only when compiling for midi output?

- plan cymbal notation

- shots on tenors

- ability to specify the number of basses (for unison expansion ... or should we even expand them)?

- ability to specify the measure to use for the tapoff (what if we don't want it to be snare?)

Done:

- explicit \break every 4 measures
- proper clef on percussion staves

Questions:

- deduce whether a note should be dotted automatically as a compiler optimization?

- how should i handle flams on tenors? new character?
	- do i condense the two notes following a comma into 1 note, with a flam flag, and a grace surface specifier?
